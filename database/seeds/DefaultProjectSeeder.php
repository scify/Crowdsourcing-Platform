                            Managers of these organisations / institutions are particularly in need for guidance on how to further develop their 
                            organizations, as they often have to work towards multiple aims simultaneously, i.e. inclusion usually is one among other aims. 
                            The typical organizational response to address inclusion is to provide teaching personnel with further qualification and training.
