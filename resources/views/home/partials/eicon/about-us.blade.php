                    <p>

                        EICON is an Erasmus+ funded project. Its main objective is to support organisations / institutions providing
                        Vocational Education and Training (VET) to become more inclusive using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).
                        We will create real-world, practice-oriented recommendations by crowdsourcing expertise from practitioners from
                        all over Europe and we will publicly share the knowledge gained.

                        Six partners from Germany, Portugal, Greece, Sweden and Finland have joined forces to elaborate practice-oriented
                        recommendations.<br><br> Partners come from organisations that provide VET (<strong>Invalidisäätiö - Keskuspuisto vocational college
                            (FI)</strong> and <strong>Cooperativa para a Educação e Reabilitação de Cidadãos Inadaptados de Cascais – CERCICA (PT)</strong>),
                        that support organisations / institutions that provide VET <strong>(Specialpedagogiska skolmyndigheten – SPSM (SE)</strong> and
                        the <strong>National Ministry of Education, Research and Religious Affairs (EL)</strong>), that provide technology for VET organisations
                        and individuals <strong>(EPISTIMI GIA SENA ASTIKI MI KERDOSKOPIKI ETAIRIA (EL)</strong>) and that support organisations in complex change
                        processes <strong>(Institut für Technologie und Arbeit – ITA (DE)</strong>; project coordinator).

                    <h2 class="text-center">Crowdsourcing expertise</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
                        Crowdsourcing is a way of solving problems and producing new ideas by connecting online with people
                        that you otherwise wouldn’t reach, giving citizens/experts the opportunity to learn from others,
                        collaborate and participate in the decision-making process.
                        We created a platform where experts and practitioners can share their expertise, co-creating value
                        and the knowledge gained. The platform:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>&#10004; allows experts to speak up and provide insights</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>&#10004; encourages participants to invite more experts</p>

                            <p>&#10004; gives you feedback on your real impact</p>

                            <p>&#10004; creates value for all</p>
