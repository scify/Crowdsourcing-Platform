                    <li>Pedagogy & teaching / learning approaches</li>
                    <li>Technology & infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Establishing & maintaining links to employment / labour market</li>
                    <li>Stakeholder involvement, collaboration & partnerships</li>
                    <li>Leadership</li>
                    <li>Transition & target scenarios for VET organisations</li>
                    <li>Continuous improvement process</li>
                </ol>
            Our work is being published for a certain time on the crowdsourcing platform to collect further ideas,
            comments or suggested changes from a wider audience in Europe.

            <br>
            <br>
            So we are bringing practitionersâ€™ views in, to combine them with theory and research results.
            At the end, we will publicly share the knowledge gained!

            <br>
            <br>

            The future is being created now. By us all.
