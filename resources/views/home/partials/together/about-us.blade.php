                    <p>SciFY is a not-for-profit organization, that develops cutting-edge information technology systems
                        and <b>freely offers them to all</b>, including the design, the implementation details, and the

                        We use our expertise in <b>artificial intelligence</b> and other technologies, and a strong

                        collaborators (universities, research institutes, NGOs and companies) to collaboratively produce
                        new solutions.

                    <p>
                        Crowdsourcing is a way of solving problems and producing new ideas
                        by connecting online with
                        people that you otherwise wouldnâ€™t reach, giving citizens the <strong>opportunity to learn from
                            others,
                            collaborate and participate in the decision-making.</strong>
