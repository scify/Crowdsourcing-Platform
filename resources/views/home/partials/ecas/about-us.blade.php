                    <p >The European Citizen Action Service (ECAS) is an international,
                        Brussels-based non-profit organisation with a pan-European membership and 27 years of experience in
                        empowering citizens.
                        ECAS believes in an <strong>inclusive, transparent, citizen-centric and democratic European
                        Union</strong> in which citizens’
                        rights are at the heart of decision making at all levels and in which citizens are informed, consulted
                        and can actively participate.

                    <p>
                        Crowdsourcing is a way of solving problems and producing new ideas
                        by connecting online with
                        people that you otherwise wouldn’t reach, giving citizens the <strong>opportunity to learn from others,
                        collaborate and participate in the decision-making.</strong>
