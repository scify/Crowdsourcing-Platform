                                <p>As a crowdsourcing platform we welcome everyone, and encourage a friendly and positive environment.
                                    This code of conduct outlines our expectations from participants to ascertain successful participation, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring environment for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the Platform or their responses can be deleted.
                                During your participation in crowdsourcing projects:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Be clear and relevant to the topic:</strong> Try to be precise and explain your thoughts and arguments with clarity. All answers must be relevant to the topic of the questionnaire. This will facilitate the platform’s moderators work, where they will have to analyze all given answers, categorize them and produce valuable insights that can have a positive impact οn the society.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Be respectful and kind:</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. It’s important to remember that even though the answers you provide are anonymous, an environment where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Of course harassment, insults, posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”), racist or sexist terms, and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.
                                        If you just keep “respectful and kind” in mind, you can't go wrong.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Remember that your contribution is public:</strong>Your email and any personal information is not revealed by the platform.  Though the textual answers you provide in the questionnaires, the answers to open-ended questions, may be publicly available. Do not include any personal information in your responses that you do not wish to be publicly available.
