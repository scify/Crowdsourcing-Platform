            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <h5>1.1</h5> We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of platform Memor-i Studio (Platform) users.
            <h5>1.2</h5> This policy applies where we are acting as a data controller with respect to the personal data
            of our Platform users; in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that
            personal data.
            <h5>1.3</h5> We use cookies on our Platform. Insofar as those cookies are not strictly necessary for the
            provision of our Platform, we will ask you to consent to our use of cookies when you first use our Platform.
            <h5>1.4</h5> For any request or comment please contact info@scify.org

            <h2>3.</h2> How we use your personal data
            <h5>3.1</h5> We may process your account data ("account data"). The account data include your name and email
            address. The source of the account data is you. The account data may be processed for the purposes of
            operating our Platform, providing our services, ensuring the security of our website and services,
            maintaining back-ups of our databases and communicating with you. The legal basis for this processing is for
            you to be able to access the Platform, play the existing games, report any inappropriate games and of course
            create your own games.
            <h5>3.2</h5> We may process information that you post for publication on our Platform ("publication data").
            The publication data may be processed images, texts or sounds from the games you may create. The legal basis
            for this processing is to communicate the game you developed and shared publicly so that more people learn
            about it and use it.
            <h5>3.3</h5> We may process information contained in or relating to any communication that you send to us
            ("correspondence data"). The correspondence data may include your name and email. The correspondence data
            may be processed for the purposes of communicating with you and record-keeping. The legal basis for this
            processing is to answer to any questions or comments you may have or to let you know if there is a problem
            with the Platform.
            <h5>3.4</h5> In addition to the specific purposes for which we may process your personal data set out in
            this Section 3, we may also process your name and email where such processing is necessary for compliance
            with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital
            interests of another natural person.
            <h5>3.5</h5> Please do not supply any other person's personal data to us.
            <h2>4.</h2> Providing your personal data to others
            <h5>4.1</h5> We do not disclose your personal data (name and email) to any natural person (besides the
            authorized SciFY staff) or legal entity.
            <h2>5.</h2> International transfers of your personal data
            <h5>5.1</h5> We do not transfer your personal data (name and email) to countries outside the European
            Economic Area (EEA).
            <h2>6.</h2> Retaining and deleting personal data
            <h5>6.1</h5> This Section 6 sets out our data retention policies and procedure, which are designed to help
            ensure that we comply with our legal obligations in relation to the retention and deletion of personal data.
            <h5>6.2</h5> Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is
            necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
            <h5>6.3</h5> It is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data (Name
            and Email address) will be retained. In this case, the period of retention will be determined based on the
            period that the Platform will be available for the public.
            <h5>6.4</h5> Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6, we may retain your personal data where
            such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to
            protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
            <h2>7.</h2> Amendments
            <h5>7.1</h5> We may update this policy from time to time by publishing a new version on our Platform.

            <h2>8.</h2> Your rights
            <h5>8.1</h5> In this Section 8, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some
            of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you
            should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these
            rights.
            <h5>8.2</h5> Your principal rights under data protection law are:
            (a) the right to access;
            (b) the right to rectification;
            (c) the right to erasure;
            (d) the right to restrict processing;
            (e) the right to object to processing;
            (f) the right to data portability;
            (g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
            (h) the right to withdraw consent.
            <h5>8.3</h5> You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and,
            where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional
            information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned
            and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we
            will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but
            additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You can access your personal data (Name and Email
            address) upon your demand by written notice to us.
            <h5>8.4</h5> You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into
            account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.
            <h5>8.5</h5> In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue
            delay upon your demand by written notice to us.
            <h5>8.6</h5> In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data.
            Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you
            oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require
            personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to
            processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis,
            we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent;
            for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another
            natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
            <h5>8.7</h5> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to
            your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the
            processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise
            of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a
            third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can
            demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and
            freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
            <h5>8.8</h5> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing
            purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease
            to process your personal data for this purpose.
            <h5>8.9</h5> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or
            historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation,
            unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
            <h5>8.10</h5> To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:
            (a) consent; or
            (b) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to
            take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract,
            and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from
            us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it
            would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
            <h5>8.11</h5> If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection
            laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data
            protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place
            of the alleged infringement.
            <h5>8.12</h5> To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent,
            you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
            processing before the withdrawal.
            <h5>8.13</h5> You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.
