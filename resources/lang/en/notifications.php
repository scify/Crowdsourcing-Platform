<p>While the first round was about identifying problems in the context of digitalization, it is now about working together with you to find solutions to these problems.</p>

<p>To this end, you can now make solution proposals on our platform and vote on already proposed solutions.</p>

<p>Here is the link to the platform: <a href="https://crowdsourcing.ecas.org/de/inclusive-digitalisation-in-the-EU-de">https://crowdsourcing.ecas.org/de/inclusive-digitalisation-in-the-EU-de</a></p>

<p>From the proposed solutions, we will formulate concrete policy recommendations in the final phase and send them to the EU. We will of course let you know as soon as this phase begins.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions. You can also find more information on our website. Also, feel free to share our call with people in your network who might be interested in the project.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your participation. We look forward to your solution proposals!</p>',
