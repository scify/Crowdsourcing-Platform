phase, and we are kindly requesting your help once more.</p>

<p><i>The next phase</i></p>

<p>As you might remember, the first phase centered around identifying problems related to
digitalisation. In this next phase, we want to focus on finding solutions to these
problems. We are therefore asking you to help us once more by logging into the platform
and voting on some identified solutions to the problems. Should you have additional or
better ideas, you can even propose your own ideas!</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">It doesn\'t take more than 5 minutes and will greatly help towards creating inclusive and
future-proof digital policies.</p>

<p><i>About the project</i></p>

<p>After the current phase, we will formulate concrete policy recommendations for the
European Union based on the problems and solutions given to us on the platform by
European citizens - including you! We will reach out to you once more when that time
comes.</p>

<p>In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or remarks.
We would greatly appreciate it if you could share this request with people in your
network who may be interested in the project.</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance for your participation. We look forward to seeing your
proposed solutions.</p>',
